/**
 * Multi-line text formatting and layout utilities.
 *
 * Provides functions specifically for working with multi-line strings treated as text content:
 * - **Line operations**: Split into lines, join lines, map transformations per line
 * - **Indentation**: Add/remove indentation, strip common leading whitespace
 * - **Alignment**: Pad text, span to width, fit to exact width
 * - **Block formatting**: Format blocks with prefixes, styled borders
 *
 * **Use Text for**: Operations that treat strings as multi-line content with visual layout
 * (indentation, padding for tables, line-by-line transformations).
 *
 * **Use root Str for**: Primitive string operations (split, join, replace, match, trim)
 * that work on strings as atomic values.
