/**
 * Flattening data types allows us to have e.g. `Num.Even` be a type and namespace.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: TypeScript limitation with namespace and type exports
 *
 * We cannot use the pattern:
 *   export type { Foo } from './foo/__.js'
 *   export * from './foo/_.js'
 *
 * This breaks TypeScript's ability to recognize the namespace exports.
 *
 * Instead, we must use:
 *   import type { Foo as Foo_ } from './foo/__.js'
 *   export { Foo } from './foo/_.js'
 *   export type Foo = Foo_
 *
 * This pattern:
 * 1. Imports the type with an alias to avoid conflicts
 * 2. Explicitly exports the namespace value
 * 3. Creates a type alias (not a re-export) which TypeScript allows
 *
 * This enables `Num.Foo` to work as both a type and a namespace.
