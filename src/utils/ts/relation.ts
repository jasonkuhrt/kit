   * Classify how the SECOND type parameter relates to the FIRST type parameter.

   *   See: {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtyping | Subtyping on Wikipedia}
   *
   * - `'supertype'` - B is a supertype of A (A extends B, B is wider/more general than A).
   *   This is the inverse of subtyping. See: {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtyping#Subsumption | Subsumption}
   *
   * - `'equivalent'` - A and B are mutually assignable (both extend each other).
   *   Also known as type equality in structural type systems.
   *   See: {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Type_equivalence | Type Equivalence}
   *
   * - `'overlapping'` - Types share some possible values but neither is a subtype of the other.
   *   Common in structural typing where types can share properties without a subtype relationship.
   *   See: {@link https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-compatibility.html | TypeScript Type Compatibility}
   *
   * - `'disjoint'` - Types have no values in common (their intersection is empty/never).
   *   See: {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_union | Disjoint Sets Theory}
   *
   * @remarks
   * This utility analyzes type relationships based on TypeScript's structural type system,
   * where type compatibility is determined by structure rather than declaration.
