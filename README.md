# Kit

## Installation

```sh
npm add @wollybeard/kit
```

## About

- I accumulated a threshold of value across various utility functions across various projects over years that I watned to stop repeating and start organizing.
- Work in progress, breaking changes daily/weekly.
- Note: the author does occasionally have a wolly beard.

## Goals

- Maximum type safety
- Maximum tree shakabiliy
- Maximum inline JSDoc
- Functional interface
- High performance (close to native as practical)
- Organized by data structure with consistent base interfaces (e.g. `Arr.is`, `Obj.is`, `Str.is`, ...)

## Documentation

For now read the code, things are very self contained.
I will focus on JSDoc before writing here.

## Contributing

I am open to contributions!
