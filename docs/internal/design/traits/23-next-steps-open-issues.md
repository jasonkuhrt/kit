# Next Steps and Open Issues

## Overview

After extensive design exploration, this document captures the remaining open issues and next steps for implementing the trait system.

## Critical Issues (Must Resolve Before Implementation)

### 1. Global Registry Domain Registration Mechanism

**Problem**: How and when do domains register their trait implementations?

**Open Questions**:

- When do domains register? (Import-time side effects?)
- How to ensure registration happens before trait usage?
- How to handle registration order dependencies?

**Needs**:

- Concrete registration flow
- Import order guarantees
- Circular dependency prevention strategy

### 2. Concrete API Design

**Problem**: Need to finalize the actual APIs developers will use.

**Needs**:

- Registration API (`registerTrait`, `getTrait`, etc.)
- Context API (`withTraits`, `withDebug`, etc.)
- Plugin API for extensions
- Configuration API for different environments

### 3. Type System Integration

**Problem**: TypeScript integration details are still hand-wavy.

**Needs**:

- Declaration merging for plugin trait extensions
- Type-level verification that domains implement traits correctly
- Generic constraints for trait methods (e.g., `Range<T>`)
- Type inference across trait dispatch

## High Priority (Needed for MVP)

### 4. Error Handling Strategy

**Problem**: How do errors work in the trait system?

**Needs**:

- Error types for trait dispatch failures
- Helpful error messages for debugging
- Stack traces through trait dispatch
- Graceful degradation when implementations are missing

### 5. Real-World Implementation Proof

**Problem**: Need a working prototype to validate design.

**Needs**:

- Implement Range trait for Num, Str, Date
- Build working trait dispatch
- Test in multiple environments (Node, Browser, CF Workers)
- Measure actual performance impact

### 6. Tree-Shaking Rollup Plugin

**Problem**: How to eliminate unused trait implementations?

**Needs**:

- Static analysis of trait usage
- Code transformation to eliminate unused implementations
- Integration with existing bundler tree-shaking
- Documentation of tree-shaking trade-offs

## Medium Priority (Can be addressed post-MVP)

### 7. Performance Benchmarking

**Problem**: Need concrete data on performance implications.

**Needs**:

- Dispatch overhead vs direct calls
- Bundle size impact of trait system
- Memory usage of registries
- Comparison with direct imports

### 8. Testing Strategy

**Problem**: How to test the trait system itself?

**Needs**:

- Mocking trait implementations for tests
- Testing trait dispatch logic
- Integration testing across multiple environments
- Performance testing of dispatch overhead

### 9. Migration Strategy

**Problem**: How do existing Kit users adopt traits?

**Needs**:

- Backward compatibility guarantees
- Migration path from direct imports to traits
- Coexistence of trait and non-trait APIs
- Documentation and examples

### 10. Documentation Strategy

**Problem**: The trait system is complex - how to explain it?

**Needs**:

- Mental models for users
- Examples for common use cases
- Migration guides
- Troubleshooting guides

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

1. Implement basic trait registry
2. Create Range trait as proof of concept
3. Build dispatch mechanism
4. Add TypeScript types

### Phase 2: Multi-Environment Support

1. Add AsyncContext support
2. Test in CF Workers
3. Implement hybrid registry approach
4. Create environment detection

### Phase 3: Developer Experience

1. Error handling improvements
2. Debug tooling
3. Documentation
4. Examples

### Phase 4: Optimization

1. Performance benchmarking
2. Tree-shaking plugin
3. Bundle size optimization
4. Production readiness

## Key Decisions Still Needed

1. **Import-time registration**: Side effects or explicit?
2. **Proxy usage**: Use proxy for trait dispatch or not?
3. **API style**: Functional or OOP-style API?
4. **Extension mechanism**: Build-time or runtime?
5. **Default behavior**: Fail fast or graceful degradation?

## Success Criteria

The trait system will be considered successful when:

1. âœ… Users can use traits without understanding implementation
2. âœ… Tree-shaking still works for direct imports
3. âœ… Works in all target environments
4. âœ… Performance overhead is acceptable (<10% for most operations)
5. âœ… Extensions can be added without modifying Kit
6. âœ… Type safety is maintained throughout

## Next Action Items

1. **Prototype** basic trait dispatch with Range
2. **Benchmark** dispatch overhead
3. **Design** concrete registration API
4. **Test** in CF Workers environment
5. **Write** initial documentation

Have a great date! ðŸŽ‰ The trait system design is in a solid place - ready for implementation when you return.
