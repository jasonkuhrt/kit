## [Arr](/api/arr)

Array utilities for working with readonly and mutable arrays. Provides functional utilities for array operations including mapping, filtering, type guards, and conversions. Emphasizes immutable operations and type safety.

## [Err](/api/err)

Error handling utilities for robust error management. Provides utilities for error inspection, stack trace manipulation, try-catch wrappers, type guards, and null safety. Features formatted error logging and error wrapping utilities.

## [Fn](/api/fn)

Function utilities for functional programming patterns. Provides utilities for function composition, currying, partial application, piping, and common functional patterns like identity and constant functions. Includes function analysis tools and endomorphism utilities.

## [Json](/api/json)

JSON utilities with Effect Schema integration. Provides type-safe JSON operations including type guards, parsing, encoding, and validation using Effect Schema. Supports JSON primitives, objects, and recursive value structures with comprehensive error handling.

## [Num](/api/num)

Numeric types and utilities with branded types for mathematical constraints. Provides branded number types (Positive, Negative, Even, Odd, etc.) with runtime validation, mathematical operations, range types, and specialized numeric domains like Complex, Ratio, and BigInt. Includes type guards, ordering, and equivalence utilities.

## [Obj](/api/obj)

Object utilities for working with plain JavaScript objects. Provides type-safe utilities for object operations including property access, manipulation, merging, filtering, and transformations. Supports both value-level and type-level operations with strong type inference.

## [Prom](/api/prom)

Promise utilities for asynchronous operations. Provides utilities for working with Promises including deferred promise creation, promise combinators, and async control flow patterns.

## [Rec](/api/rec)

Record utilities for working with plain JavaScript objects as dictionaries. Provides type-safe operations for records (objects with PropertyKey indexes) including type guards, merging, creation, and index signature manipulation. Strictly validates plain objects, rejecting arrays and class instances.

## [Str](/api/str)

String utilities for text manipulation and analysis. Provides comprehensive string operations including case conversion, splitting, matching, replacement, templating, and character utilities. Features type-safe APIs with strong inference for string literals and patterns.

## [Test](/api/test)

Enhanced test utilities for table-driven testing with Vitest. Provides builder API and type-safe utilities for parameterized tests with built-in support for todo, skip, and only cases.

## [Ts](/api/ts)

TypeScript type utilities and type-level programming helpers. Provides comprehensive type-level utilities including type printing, static errors, type guards, simplification utilities, exact type matching, and type testing tools. Features conditional types, type transformations, and type-level assertions for advanced TypeScript patterns.

## [Value](/api/value)

General value utilities for common JavaScript values and patterns. Provides utilities for lazy values, type guards for symbols and dates, identity proxies, and lazy value resolution. Includes helpers for working with deferred computations and value type checking.
