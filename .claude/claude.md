## Backwards Compatibility

**Default stance: Breaking changes are acceptable.**

This is a pre-1.0 library under active development. Unless explicitly instructed otherwise for a specific task, you should:

- Prioritize clean design over backwards compatibility
- Make breaking changes freely when they improve the API
- Not worry about migration paths or deprecation warnings
- Focus on the best long-term solution

Backwards compatibility will ONLY be considered when explicitly mentioned in the task requirements.
